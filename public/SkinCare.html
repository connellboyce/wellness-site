Additionally, shedding skin cells throughout the day, so it is significant to keep your skin in good condition. Before taking care of your skin, you need to know what skin type you have. There are many different types of skins and each one has specific routines that can help prevent acne, treat wrinkles, and help your skin looking its best.<br><br>Below list are different skin types with the recommended products to use while following the skincare steps above. <i id="disclaimer"><br>(Disclaimer: Not all products/treatment may not be effective, everyone’s skin is different and will react differently, do a patch test before using the products.)</i></p>

            <p class="accordionText">

              <ol id="steps">
                <li>Wash Face Regularly</li>
                <br>
                Wash face with a gentle soap or cleanser and warm water. Try to avoid facial cleanser with fragrances and harsh chemicals, which can irritate and strip your skin from its natural oils, making your skin produce more sebum. Also, avoid using washcloths or brushes that will cause friction to the skin that can irritate the skin. Gently rub the cleanser on your skin for at least 20 secs and making sure all the product is completely rinsed off.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Pat Face dry</li>
                <br>
                When drying your face, gently pat it with a clean washcloth or paper towel. Do put friction when wiping or rubbing your face with the towel, this can be harsh on your skin and cause irritation. Make sure you switch out your towels regularly since washcloths can carry bacteria when using it on your face multiple times.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Use Toner</li>
                <br>
                Use toners such as apple cider vinegar mixed with water, witch hazel or other toners with skin-soothing properties. Using a toner after washing your face can help remove remaining products or makeup that is still on your face that the cleanser didn’t remove. Avoid strong and harsh toners that can dry out your skin.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Use Facial Mask & Exfoliate (Weekly)</li>
                <br>
                This step is optional, but sometimes using a certain facial mask or exfoliating once a week can be beneficial for treating all skin types by removing dead skin cells that can build up on the surface of your skin. Don’t use it more than once or twice a week, to prevent the skin from excessive dryness, irritation, redness, and sensitivity.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Using ingredients such as:</li>
                <br>
                - Clay: Mask containing minerals like smectite or bentonite can absorb oils and reduce shininess on the skin, as well as, control sebum levels without irritating the skin.
                <br>
                - Honey: Raw honey has antibacterial and antiseptic qualities that can reduce acne and oily skin, just apply on skin for 10 minutes and wash off.
                <br>
                - Oatmeal: Help cleanse the skin. Oatmeal contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory that can soothe irritated skin.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Moisturize</li>
                <br>
                Always moisturize! For those with oily skin, you may think you don’t need moisture and fear that can make your skin look greasier. But, that not true if you use the right moisturizer fit for your skin. Using oil-free moisturizers can help the skin hydrated and protected, without feeling greasy. No matter what skin type you have, you should always moisturize.

                <br>
                <br>

              <li>Sunscreen</li>
                <br>
                Most importantly SUNSCREEN! This is essential no matter if you are going out or not. It’s important to apply sunscreen because your skin is always exposed to strong UV rays even you don’t see the sun on cloudy days the UV rays are still there. Sun UV radiation is known to be the main cause of skin cancer. So, make sure you apply a layer of sunscreen on top of your moisturizer unless you moisturizer already has SPF in it. But, there is nothing wrong with taking precautions and applying extra sunscreen anyways.

            <p class="accordionText">
              Oily skin is caused by sebaceous glands in the skin that produce excess sebum. Sebum is the waxy and oily substance that protects and hydrates the skin. Production of sebum is vital for keeping the skin healthy, however, too much sebum production can cause oily skin, clogged pores, and acne. So, it is important to manage your skin regularly as possible.

Dry skin can also be caused by changes in temperature or humanity.
